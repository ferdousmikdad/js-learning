// Sometimes, we might be dealing with a list of objects.
// For example, 

let selectedColors = ['red', 'blue'];
//the index of the first element is 0 as you can see in console.
selectedColors[2] = 1;
//Now, let's display this array on console.
console.log(selectedColors.length);
//So, we have an array with 3 
//So the length is dynamic, it can change.
