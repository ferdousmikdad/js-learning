// JavaScript is a dynamic language.  
// What do I mean by dynamic?
// we have two types of programming languages. 
// Static languages or Dynamic language.

//In static languages, when we declare a variable, the type of the variable is set and it cannot be changed

//In dynamic languages like JS, the type of a variable can change at run time. Let's see this in the code.

let name = 'Ferdous';
let age = 26;  
let isApproved = true; 
let firstName = undefined;
let selectedColor = null;

//check these in console and type in the console like 
// typeof name
// You will get the answer "string"
// If we set the value of name like "name = 1"
// you will get the answer "number" when you will type in the console "type of name" after change the value of name

// You can google or ChatGpt it if you don't understand better.
