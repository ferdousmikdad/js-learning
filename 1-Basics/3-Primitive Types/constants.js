//So you have learned how to declare and initialize a variable.
//In JavaScript we have two categories of types.

// Primitives/Value Types
//On one side, we have primitives, also called Value Types

//Reference Types. We will learn about it later in the course.

//In the category of primitives,
//We have String, Number, Boolean, Undefined and Null

// Let's look each of these in action 

let name = 'Ferdous';   //String Literal
let age = 26;           //Number Literal
let isApproved = true;  //Boolean Literal
// So the value of a boolean variable can be true or false.
let firstName = undefined;
// let lastName = null;
let selectedColor = null;

// These are the example of primitive types. 
//We have strings, numbers, booleans, undefined and null.

//Now in ES6 we have another primitive that is symbol.
