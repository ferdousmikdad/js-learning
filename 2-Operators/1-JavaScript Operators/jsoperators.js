//Operators
//In JS we have different kinds of operators. 
//Use these operators along with our variables
//and constants to create expressions.
//And with these expressions we can implement logic and algorithms

//Different kinds of operators
//1. Arithmetic
//2. Assignment
//3. Comparison
//4. Logical
//5. Bitwise

//We will learn each of these in detail.
