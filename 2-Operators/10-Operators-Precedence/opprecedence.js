// Operators Precedence
// When working with complex expression, 
// one thing that you need to account for is the precedence of operators
// example, 
// let x = 2 + 3 * 4;
// console.log (x);

// Now, all these operators you have learned in this section, 
// they have their own precedence.
// It's really hard to memorize which operators have 
// ---higher precedence or lower precedence.
// So when working with complex expression you can use 
// ---parenthesis to determine how these operators are applied.
// For example, 

//  let y = (2 + 3) * 4;
//  console.log(y);
