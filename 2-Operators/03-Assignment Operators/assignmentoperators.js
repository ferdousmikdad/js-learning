//Assignment Operators

let x = 10;

// x++;
// But what is in this example instead of adding 1 to x
// We want to add 5.
// well, this increment operator will not work. 

x = x + 5;
x += 5;
//Line 11 and line 12 are exactly the same. 

x = x * 3;
x *= 3;

// So all the other arithmetic operators we learned 
// addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, and the remainder
// all of this have a combination with the assignment operator.
