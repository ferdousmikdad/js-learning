//Arithmetic Operators

let x = 10;
let y = 3;

console.log(x + y);
//That is the edition operators
//So this arithmetic operators usually take two up rands(?)
//in this case x and y.
//And then produce a new value.

//An expression is something that produce a value. 
//We also have... 
console.log(x - y);
console.log(x * y);
console.log(x / y);
console.log(x % y);

//We have a new operator in JS that is exponentiation
//it's indicated by two stars, 

console.log(x ** y);
//and that is x to the power of y.


//Tow other operators are 
//1. Increment (++)
console.log(++x);
console.log(x++);
console.log(x);


//2. Decrement (--)
console.log(--x);
